# OnlineRetailApplication

The Online Retail Application using SQL is designed to streamline various aspects of an online retail business, including product management, order processing, customer data management, and inventory tracking. It operates exclusively on a SQL database, which ensures data integrity, reliability, and scalability. Users can sort their purchases or even get insights on what products to buy. With this initiative, we hope to provide everyone with a thorough and user-friendly online retail solution.
